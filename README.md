# DAP-Project
Project Name
In this Project we are doing Data Analysis on Entertainment Industries, where we are taking 3 datasets from different sites. 
First dataset we fetched by web Scraping from the IMDB website where we fetched 17 pages.
Second dataset is of Netflix which was in json format.
Third dataset is of Amazon Prime Movie data which was in json format.

After Loading Dataset we store data in Cloud version of MongDB i.e in MongoDb Atlas.
Then we fetched and did EDA (Exploratory Data analysis) and load data in POstgresSql and after that we perform Data Visualization on it.
